1.	You are given a character array (i.e. char grade[32])  of 
32 grades spanning the values of A - F, I.  
You need to compute the histogram for each of the 
six possible grades which will be contained in a histogram array 
(i.e. int hist_grade[6])  containing six values. Using the switch 
statement structure, write a program that will calculate how many 
grades were given for each grade. Use the following values 
for the grade array:

char grade[32] = {
 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'f', 'I', 
 'b', 'C', 'd', 'F', 'I', 'a',
 'C', 'D', 'F', 'I', 'A', 'B',
 'D', 'F', 'I', 'A', 'B', 'c',
 'I' , 'D', 'F', 'F', 'A', 'B',
 'a', 'b'
  };
  
Hint: Use a for loop to walk through the grade array and within the loop have 
the switch statement populate the hist_grade array accordingly.
